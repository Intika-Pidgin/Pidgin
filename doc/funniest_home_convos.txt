17:02:17 Zilding: I'm sure not.  So forgive me when I'm not in a very good mood and I have a little contempt for people who use phrases like 'owns', can't spell correctly, and feel the need to capitalize every other letter in their name.  Are you a hax0r too?

Flyn Orange: hehe... Well, I tried to. I was feeling kinda sick. :)
Flyn Orange: Flyn Orange: Would've finished that sucker off if I'd have been feeling better!

Flyn Orange: *grin*  Thanks!

Flyn Orange: There are some truly cool people out there.

00:03:43 Flyn Orange: *shoots you with silly string*
00:03:55 RobFlynn: HELP! I AM COVERED IN NEONG REEN STRING
00:06:54 Flyn Orange: NEONG REEN, Taiwan (AP) -
                      Despite the recent economical collapses suffered due to 
                      massive geological activity over the last month, the very
                      profitable gag-manufacturer of Silly String has 
                      maintained production through the turmoil. Still 
                      employing 324 workers and a management team of 15 
                      Slinkies, there is no risk of a price hike in cans of
                      Silly String over the next few months...

Eric and I were a little weird this night hehe


03:31:43 RobFlynn: "No Bite", she rebuked.
03:31:46 RobFlynn: Rebuked is a fun word.
03:31:51 RobFlynn: I don't know if I used it properly, but it is still fun.
03:31:55 Eric Warmenhoven: i like idiosyncratic
03:32:01 RobFlynn: I like sesquipedalian
03:32:14 Eric Warmenhoven: variations on idiosyncracy are my favorite words.
03:32:20 Eric Warmenhoven: i like them.
03:32:22 RobFlynn: I like sesquipedalian because it is polysylabic by
defination and practice.
03:32:25 Eric Warmenhoven: that's one of my idiosyncracies.
03:32:40 RobFlynn: Idiosyncracy is a sesquipedalian.
03:32:48 Eric Warmenhoven: holy crap
03:33:00 RobFlynn: Sesquipedalians such as idiosyncracy are often times
considered ambiguous.  Why use a large word when a dimunitve one will suffice?

(20:38:57) marv: nosnilmot: I could explain it to you I guess. Sure why not.
(20:39:44) nosnilmot: marv: I'd like to know (I think?), but now probably isn't the best time, I shouldn't have asked
(20:40:11) marv: The buffer is composed to unescaped (no entities) text, with a certain unicode character representing images or smileys or widgets.

(20:41:10) nosnilmot: marv: don't worry, I will. I need to learn C first.

18:33:26 <NoName> hello there
18:34:03 <NoName> I just wanted to share some bevavior that I think its kinda of
                  unsafe when using GAIM with yahoo messenges accounts
18:34:43 <NoName> Whenever you transfer files between users, no receiving
                  confirmation is requested, the file gets transfered
                  automatically
18:37:32 <Paco-Paco> surely you have to accept file transfers
18:37:57 <NoName> Paco-Paco, nope, Whenever people sends me files, I get no
                  confirmation request
18:38:30 <NoName> Paco-Paco, and the files gets right through my home directory
18:39:00 <deryni> I find this a bit hard to believe since most people come in here
                  asking for some way to auto-accept.
18:39:48 <NoName> deryni, I just installed fc3 , fully updated it, no extra
                  configuration was done and that's the default behavior
18:40:06 <NoName> deryni, I searched the settings and there is no configuration
                  on this issue
18:40:29 <deryni> I know there's no configuration on it, that's what everyone keeps
                  asking for.
18:41:08 <NoName> deryni, sometimes I get pictures of naked girls in my computer
                  and I guess that GAIM is the one responsible for that since it
                  does not ask for file transfer confirmation

(00:22:45) user:         hi
(00:22:47) user:         can you help me?
(00:22:56) richielaager: I don't know.
(00:23:02) user:         can i borrow a pencil?
(00:24:13) richielaager: Only if you're willing to pay transportation costs
                         to get you the pencil, plus $60/hour for the time it
                         takes me to transport said pencil to you, plus a pencil
                         rental fee of $1/day, plus a one time pencil sharpening
                         service charge of $5.
(00:24:37) user:         I have a 100$ in paypal, where do i send it to?
(00:25:10) richielaager: I hear some guys in Nigeria are looking for account
                         information?
(00:25:32) user:         or can you put a pencil feature into gaim? to create a
                         physical pencil out of a rubber reconstruction machine?
(00:25:50) user:         those guys only sent wood- no lead :(
(00:26:10) user:         they told me it was "invisible" lead.
(00:28:27) richielaager: Interesting... They sent me plenty of visible lead,
                         they said, it's just waiting for me at a holding company
                         in Moscow or some place like that.
(00:28:53) user:         Seems you've been had.
(00:29:09) user:         The invisible lead works quite well.
(00:29:28) user:         Anyways, I'm here to ask a question.
(00:29:29) richielaager: Damn!
(00:29:42) richielaager: Damn to that too. :)

21:26 <An_Idiot> I was considering just making a remote control program
21:26 <An_Idiot> where you type in a password, send it via gaim, and
                 gaim becomes a text terminal
      [time passes ...]
21:38 <An_Idiot>  I'm terribly conservative when it comes to security

19:47 <someusr> hey
19:48 <someusr> how do i set aim to block all users except those on my
                buddy list?
19:48 <someusr> don't tell me i have to log in with the regular AIM :(
19:48 <Paco-Paco> I wouldn't tell you that, because it's wrong
19:48 <Paco-Paco> how about you look in privacy
19:49 <someusr> where?
19:49 <someusr> i can't find it
19:49 <SimGuy> in Privacy
19:49 <someusr> OH!
19:49 <someusr> haha
19:49 <someusr> thanks!

14:12 <colorshape> Is it possible for me to see my friends webcam via
                   msn in gaim?
14:12 <Paco-Paco> no
14:13 <colorshape> not voice either then i guess?
14:13 <Paco-Paco> correct
14:13 <colorshape> ok, then not much to do.
14:13 <Err> there's always seppuku
14:14 <Paco-Paco> so true

14:57 <itchypants> [blah blah blah simple question]
      [other traffic]
14:57 <itchypants> [retransmit simple question]
14:59 <seanegan> itchypants: you need to chill the hell out
14:59 <itchypants> seanegan, ah okay thanks
15:00 <seanegan> no problem

(15:57:11) sadrul: the files (at least a couple) in the tar.bz2 are different
(15:57:23) datallah: right.. that is the problem - the code in svn is fine
(15:57:31) seanegan: oh, what the hell?
(15:57:41) seanegan: don't tell me I make dist'ed the wrong tree
(15:57:46) LSchiere: how does the code in svn differ except in gaim's
funniest and the spec.in?
(15:57:50) LSchiere: seanegan: sounds like it
(15:57:53) datallah: you are such a screw up!
(15:58:12) seanegan: I sure am
(15:58:32) seanegan: Ugh!
(15:58:37) datallah: you must have been distracted by um... plugins
(15:58:45) seanegan: Don't I test these things?
(15:58:51) LSchiere: you test things?
(15:59:06) SimGuy: seanegan: by experience, I think we've determined you do
not :)

(07:52:07 PM) clueless21: are you one of the gaim makers?
(07:52:14 PM) Nathan Walp: yes
(07:52:24 PM) clueless21:  cool
(07:52:37 PM) clueless21:  if your busy, i can leave you alone...
(07:53:03 PM) Nathan Walp: if you have a question I can answer it
(07:53:34 PM) clueless21:  umm... well i don't exactly know what gaim does and what it's for. i don't know if i should get it
(07:53:46 PM) Nathan Walp: it is an IM client
(07:53:57 PM) clueless21:  o. what's it do?
(07:54:03 PM) clueless21:  what's an im client?
(07:54:25 PM) Nathan Walp: it lets you chat with other people, like we are chatting now
(07:54:45 PM) clueless21:  oooooooooo... thanks

23:58 -!- seanegan is now known as beta7
23:58 <beta7> Hey, guys, remember me?
23:59 <beta7> We were all supposed to be working on getting me out.
23:59 <beta7> you guys remember that?
23:59 -!- mode/#pidgin [+o elb] by ChanServ
23:59 -!- beta7 was kicked from #pidgin by elb [getting feisty, are we?]
23:59 -!- mode/#pidgin [-o elb] by ChanServ
23:59 <marv> elb: good job getting beta7 out

14:07 <elb> rizzo: I actually prefer elb, and used it for a long time -- but 
            switched to Paco-Paco because people kept asking me what an 'elb'
            was
14:08 <rizzo> elb: tell them it's short for "elbow", and don't explain any 
              further
14:08 <elb> rizzo: I actually had people ASK about that
14:08 <elb> 'is your nick elbow?'
14:08 <elb> "... yes"
14:08 <elb> I mean, what do you say
14:08 <Robot101> elb: was their nick "idi"?

--

19:23 <-- elb has quit (K-lined)

19:01 <user> whoa
19:01 <user> okay
19:01 <user> now when i try to go into the left over files after the 
             uninstall
19:01 <user> something is seriously wrong because it says "the files on the 
             c drive are not formatted, would you like to format?"
19:03 <user> manually deleting the folder from command gives me a "Data 
             error (cyclic redundancy check)."
19:03 <elb> remember, one line per thought
19:03 <elb> and yes, you have something wrong with your computer, we've 
            established that
19:03 <user> its functioning just fine

17:12 <a_user> I think I foundage a bug
17:13 <a_user> I don't think blocking works correctly for the AIM protocol
17:13 <a_user> because a girl attempted to block me in pidgin and I can still
               talk to her
17:14 <a_user> [screen name expunged]: I already told you yesterday. You don't
               need me to ease your mind, you want me to change MY mind. Well,
               you're out of luck. I don't know how you're still messaging me,
               because I already blocked you, but I demand you stop immediately.
               For now on, I will save every message that you send me as
               evidence for the next time I decide to call the police. I did
               call them yesterday, but I didn't have evidence. The more you
               message me now, the more you're digging you're own grave, so I
               advice you to stop.
17:14 <a_user> see?
17:16 <sadrul> I think blocking in pidgin not working is not your biggest
               problem here.

12:58 <staggered_ranks> why hasn't support for napster been removed?
12:58 <deryni> It has.
12:59 <staggered_ranks> oh.. ok

(14:30:09) linux_user: i have a ?
(14:31:03) linux_user: when i install this on wine and run it it come up as
           boxes on the screen
(14:31:26) nosnilmot: why on earth would you install Pidgin under wine?
(14:31:41) Err: heh
(14:31:48) Err: I think my brain just segfaulted on that
(14:31:58) linux_user: well i am on linux
(14:32:10) linux_user: linux mint and thay is the only way i can run it

--

14:39 <rrobbertt> Does anyone know a way to get text to speech with pidgin?
14:41 <elb> do you want to be rooted sooner, or later?
14:42 <seanegan> good question"; rm -rf ~

(11:55:03) *** elb cuts seanegn for taunting the masses with adium
                   message styles and then dropping it
(11:55:32) *** rekkanoryo cuts seanegn twice for the same reason
(11:56:04) *** elb waits to see if this is an additive, fibbonaci, or
                   exponential cutting
(11:56:16) *** seanegn hopes for additive.

/* explaining the behavior of g_list_delete_link */
(13:15:04) elb: if the item is not part of the list, it will be
           removed from whatever list it *was* in
(13:15:20) elb: and if it was the head of that list, and the caller is
           holding onto the head someplace, Bad Things happen
(13:15:55) elb: don't do that
(13:15:57) elb: is my advice on the matter
/* more than 3 hours later */
(16:58:10) elb: I just spent literally a couple of HOURS trying to
           debug a problem where I was using g_list_delete_link with a
           list item which wasn't in the list

22:35 <user> hi I know this might sound like a stupid question and I am NOT
             trolling..
22:36 <user> but when I go to some channels like anime ones people lol at me
             for using pidgen
22:36 <user> why do they think this is a bad client? does it have history?

--

15:45 <deryni> We've had a Grand Plugin Database Plan for approximately forever.
15:45 <SimGuy> ah, the GPDP
15:46 <khc> well, there was a Grand Smiley Theme Database
15:47 <SimGuy> the GSTD sounds like a bad acronym
15:47 <khc> I realized after typing that

(01:51:38 AM) user entered the room.
(01:52:46 AM) user: .addKeyActionListener(new KeyActionListener() onKeyPress() {if (event.geyKeyPresss().equals(Key.UP_ARROW) { inputbox.text = history.pop() }}}}}}});
(01:52:51 AM) user: THERE, FOR **** SAKE
(01:52:53 AM) user: its 2009
(01:53:06 AM) user: oh wait. ctrl up works
(01:53:07 AM) user: lol
(01:53:11 AM) user: yey me
(01:53:16 AM) user left the room.
(01:55:31 AM) darkrain42: Wow.
(01:58:15 AM) QuLogic: I think he failed to realize we'd have to re-write pidgin in java to do that
(01:59:44 AM) khc: history.pop() is clearly wrong too

--

Some time later:
(02:41:55 AM) user entered the room.
(02:42:24 AM) user: didn't I read some idiot post, about 2 years ago, before pidgin was renamed / forked, over one dev refusing to make minimize on close?
(02:43:12 AM) QuLogic: I see you've learned to at least ask a question before jumping to random conclusions
(02:44:01 AM) user: QuLogic: :-))))))))))))))))))))))
(02:44:12 AM) user: hey, I submitted a code patch!
(02:44:36 AM) user: now, anyway, what happened? why did I get the buddy list (empty) stealing focus, and why did it exit on close?
(02:44:40 AM) QuLogic: it's not really a patch if it's in the wrong language
(02:44:42 AM) user: I've had this argument before, in 2006
(02:44:55 AM) user: QuLogic: simple, rewrite the rest ;-)
(02:44:58 AM) khc: pidgin never steals focus
(02:45:10 AM) khc: if it exit on close, it's because you didn't turn on the systray icon
(02:47:17 AM) user: khc - and that isn't default... why? anyway. I recall something on the matter, and I think this was the project (pre-fork?) or is this the unforked, renamed? I forget.
(02:47:42 AM) user: Whoever it was arguing about it (and font sizes I believe) was an idiot... not one of you I suppose, just making idle chit chat.
(02:47:43 AM) user: thanks
(02:47:48 AM) darkrain42: It is on by default. Some distros change that.
(02:48:00 AM) darkrain42: And I don't even know what you're arguing about at this point.
(02:48:11 AM) user: ... /leave - That command doesn't work on this protocol... /leave #pidgin ...That comm..... :-(((
(02:48:18 AM) user: darkrain42: now arguing, just remembering something
(02:48:27 AM) user left the room.
(02:49:04 AM) darkrain42: Wow. (again)

(13:34:15) elb: I think when 3.0 gets closer we should have a long string freeze and beg for active translations
(13:34:57) maiku: Probably not unwise as much a such terms make me cringe :-D
(13:35:09) dx: bonus points for not forgetting that there's a string freeze during the string freeze
(13:35:18) *** dx sets low standards
(13:35:33) maiku: Well now you're just taking the fun out of it :-D
(13:36:06) dx: i don't think string freezes are supposed to be fun
