.SH Widget Actions
You can specifiy key-bindings for specific widgets. The following entries in
\fI~/.gntrc\fR correspond to the default keybindings for the actions:

.br
[GntBox::binding]
.br
tab = focus-next
.br
right = focus-next
.br
left = focus-prev

.br
[GntComboBox::binding]
.br
down = dropdown
.br
up = dropdown

.br
[GntEntry::binding]
.br
c-a = cursor-home
.br
home = cursor-home
.br
c-e = cursor-end
.br
end = cursor-end
.br
backspace = delete-prev
.br
del = delete-next
.br
c-d = delete-next
.br
c-u = delete-start
.br
c-k = delete-end
.br
c-b = cursor-prev
.br
left = cursor-prev
.br
c-f = cursor-next
.br
right = cursor-next
.br
tab = suggest-show
.br
down = suggest-next
.br
up = suggest-prev
.br
page-down = suggest-next-page
.br
page-up = suggest-prev-page
.br
c-w = delete-prev-word
.br
a-b = cursor-prev-word
.br
a-f = cursor-next-word
.br
a-d = delete-next-word
.br
c-v = clipboard-paste
.br
c-p = history-prev
.br
c-n = history-next
.br
c-r = history-search
.br
c-up = history-prev
.br
c-down = history-next

.br
[GntTree::binding]
.br
up = move-up
.br
down = move-down
.br
c-n = move-down
.br
c-p = move-up
.br
pageup = page-up
.br
pagedown = page-down
.br
backspace = move-parent
.br
home = move-first
.br
end = move-last
.br
# Following is the default binding for the context-menu
.br
menu = context-menu
.br
# The following will let you open the context-menu in the buddylist with c-b
.br
# c-b = context-menu

.br
[GntWidget::binding]
.br
f11 = context-menu
.br
c-x = context-menu

[GntWindow::binding]
.br
c-o = show-menu
.br
f10 = show-menu

The \fBc-\fR corresponds to the \fBControl\fR key. You can also use \fBctrl-\fR
or \fBctr-\fR or \fBctl-\fR to indicate a combination. For alt-keys, you can use
one of \fBa-\fR, \fBalt-\fR, \fBm-\fR or \fBmeta-\fR. You can also use
\fBhome\fR, \fBend\fR, \fBleft\fR, \fBright\fR etc. keys.

To unbind a key which has a default binding, you simply bind it to the empty string.  For example, to unbind \fBAlt + q\fR from the Quit function, you would use:

[GntWM::binding]
.br
a-q =

.SH Menus
You can also specify key-bindings to trigger specific menuitems in windows. For example, the following entry in \fI~/.gntrc\fR will bind \fBCtrl + t\fR to the 'Send IM...' item in the buddylist:

[buddylist::menu]
.br
c-t = send-im

The following is the list of IDs of the current menuitems in the buddylist:

send-im
.br
join-chat
.br
show-empty-groups
.br
show-offline-buddies
.br
sort-status
.br
sort-alpha
.br
sort-log
.br
add-buddy
.br
add-chat
.br
add-group

.SH Mouse Support
There is experimental mouse support. You can focus windows, activate buttons,
select rows in a list, scroll using the wheel-scroll etc. Selecting text in a
text-view copies it to the gnt clipboard. Mouse support is disabled by default,
so you need to enable it in \fI~/.gntrc\fR (see the sample above).

.SH Window Management
The default window management is very limited. But it is possible to write
custom window managers to suit your needs. There is a sample window-manager
included (named \fIs.so\fR) which adds a little 'close-button' for the windows,
removes the borders from the buddylist and pops up new windows in the middle of
the screen, instead of at the upper-left corder. It is provided as a sample
simple manager, but it should be possible to write more complex managers, and
it's very possible that the window-manager API will need to be enhanced. Look at
the sample \fI~/.gntrc\fR file above to see how to select a window-manager.

It is also possible to rebind the window-manager actions in \fI~/.gntrc\fR, eg:

.br
[GntWM::binding]
.br
a-n = window-next
.br
a-p = window-prev
.br
a-c = window-close
.br
a-w = window-list
.br
a-d = dump-screen
.br
a-, = shift-left
.br
a-. = shift-right
.br
a-a = action-list
.br
a-m = start-move
.br
a-r = start-resize
.br
a-q = wm-quit
.br
a-l = refresh-screen
.br
a-s = workspace-list
.br
a-t = window-tag
.br
a-T = place-tagged
.br
a-C = toggle-clipboard
.br
a-/ = help-for-widget
.br
a-c-j = window-scroll-down
.br
a-c-k = window-scroll-up
.br
# The following action is still incomplete, and doesn't have a default binding
.br
# switch-window-n
.br
# Other actions: window-next-urgent, window-prev-urgent

# For the sample custom window manager
.br
[GntS::binding]
.br
a-b = toggle-buddylist

# For the irssi window manager
.br
[Irssi::binding]
.br
a-L = move-right
.br
a-H = move-left
.br
a-J = move-down
.br
a-K = move-up

.SH Conversation Commands

use these from any conversation to access other windows.

.B buddylist
for the buddylist.
