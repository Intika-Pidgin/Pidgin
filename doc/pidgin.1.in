.SH NAME
Pidgin v@VERSION@ \- Instant Messaging client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBpidgin \fI[options]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpidgin\fR is a graphical modular messaging client based on libpurple
which is capable of connecting to AIM, MSN, Yahoo!, XMPP, ICQ, IRC, SILC,
Novell GroupWise, Lotus Sametime, Zephyr, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at once. It has
many common features found in other clients, as well as many unique features.
Finch is not endorsed by or affiliated with America Online, ICQ, Microsoft, or
Yahoo.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are provided by Pidgin using the standard GNU
command line syntax:
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-config=\fIDIR\fB
Use \fIDIR\fR as the directory for config files instead of \fI~/.purple\fR.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Print debugging messages to stdout.  These are the same debugging messages
that are displayed in the \fBDebug Window\fR.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a summary of command line options and exit.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nologin
Don't automatically login when Pidgin starts.  Sets the global status to
\fBOffline\fR.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-login[=\fINAME\fR,\fINAME\fR,...]
Sign in the comma-separated list of accounts provided, in addition to the
accounts that would be logged in anyway.  If you do not specify such a
comma-separated list, your first account will be signed in.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print the current version and exit.

.SH BUDDY LIST
The \fBBuddy List\fR window is Pidgin's main interface window.  Using
this window you can see which of your buddies is online, away, idle, etc.
You can also add and remove buddies from your buddy list.

The \fBBuddy List\fR window contains a list of your buddies who are online
and have allowed you to be notified of their presence.  The icon to the
left of each buddy indicates the buddy's current state and the protocol
they are using.  Double clicking a buddy will open a new \fBConversation\fR
window.  Right clicking will pop up a menu:
.TP
.B Get Info
Retrieves and displays information about the buddy.  This information is
also known as a Profile.
.TP
.B IM
Opens a new \fBConversation\fR window to the selected buddy.
.TP
.B Send File
Sends a file to the selected buddy (only available on protocols that support
file transfer).
.TP
.B Add Buddy Pounce
A Buddy Pounce is a configurable automated action to be performed when the
buddy's state changes.  This will open the \fBBuddy Pounce\fR dialog to be
discussed later.
.TP
.B View Log
Pidgin is capable of automatically log its activities.  These logs are
either plain text files (with a .txt extension) or html files (with a
\&.html extension) located under the \fI~/.purple/logs\fR directory.  This
menu command will display Pidgin's log viewer with logs loaded for that
buddy or chat.
.TP
.B Alias
Create an alias for this buddy.  This will open up a new dialog in which
one can give this buddy an alternate name to appear on the buddy list and
in conversations.

For example, if a buddy's name screen name was jsmith1281xx and his real
name was 'John Q. Smith,' one could create an alias as to identify the
buddy by his common name.
.LP
The remainder of the menu will consist of protocol specific commands.
These commands vary depending on the protocol.
.LP
At the bottom of the \fBBuddy List\fR are several buttons (if enabled in
\fBPreferences\fR):
.TP
.B IM
Opens a new \fBConversation\fR window to to the selected buddy, or brings
up the \fBNew Message\fR dialog box if no buddy is selected.
.TP
.B Info
Retrieves and display information about the selected buddy, or brings up
the \fBGet User Info\fR dialog box if no buddy is selected.
.TP
.B Chat
Brings up the \fBJoin Chat\fR dialog box, prompting the user to select
which username to use and what chat group to join.
.TP
.B Away
Brings up a menu of all available \fBAway Messages\fR.  If an item is
selected, all online accounts will use this item as their away message.

.SH ACCOUNT EDITOR
The account editor consists of a list of accounts and information about
them.  Clicking \fIDelete\fR will delete the currently selected account.
Clicking \fIAdd\fR or \fIModify\fR will invoke a \fBModify Account\fR
window.  Here, you can add or alter account information.  When creating a
new account, you will submit your screen name and password.  You will also
choose your protocol.

If \fIRemember Password\fR is chosen, the password will be saved in
Pidgin's configuration file.

If \fIAuto-Login\fR is chosen, this account will automatically login upon
starting Pidgin.

Each protocol has its own specific options that can be found in the
modify screen.

can also manually enter a command to be executed when a link is clicked
(\fI%s\fR expands to the URL).  For example, \fIxterm -e lynx "%s"\fR will
open the link with lynx.  \fIOpen new window by default\fR makes the
browser use a new window instead of using the current window (or spawning a

automatically turn on the Away status.

.TP
.B Away Messages
Lets the user add/edit/remove available \fBAway Messages\fR.

.SH Plugins

Allows the user to enable add-on plugins for Pidgin.  Several of these
come with Pidgin, while others must be downloaded separately.  The
\fIDescription\fR field gives the plugin author's description of the
plugin, while the \fIDetails\fR field gives the plugin's authorship, URL,
and file name/location information.

Some plugins can be configured.  If you load such a plugin, its
configuration preferences will appear as a submenu to \fBPlugins\fR, with
the submenu title determined by the plugin's name.

.SH CONVERSATIONS
When starting a new conversation, the user is presented with the
\fBConversation\fR window.  The conversation appears in the upper text box
and the user types his/her message in the lower text box.  Between the two
is a row of options, represented by icons.  Some or all buttons may not be
active if the protocol does not support the specific formatting. From left
to right:
.TP
.B Font
This menu provides font control options for the current conversation.  Size,
style, and face may be configured here.
.TP
.B Insert
This menu provides the ability to insert images, horizontal rules, and links
where the protocol supports each of these features.
.TP
.B Smile!
Allows the insertion of graphical smileys via the mouse.  This button shows
the user a dialog with the available smileys for the current conversation.

.SH CHATS
For protocols that allow it, \fBChats\fR can be entered through the
\fIBuddies\fR menu.


Additional commands available in chat, depending on the protocol are:
.TP
.B Whisper
The text will appear in the chat conversation, but it will only be visible
to the sender and the receiver.
.TP
.B Invite
Invite other people to join the chat room.
.TP
.B Ignore
Ignore anything said by the chosen person
.TP
.B Set Topic
Set the topic of the chat room.  This is usually a brief sentence
describing the nature of the chat--an explanation of the chat room's name.

.SH STATUS MESSAGES
Most protocols allow for status messages.  By using status messages, a user
can leave an informative message for others to see.  Status and status
messages are configured via the status selector at the bottom of the Buddy
List window.  By default the menu shown here is divided into sections for
"primitive" status types, such as \fIAvailable\fR, \fIAway\fR, etc.; a few
"popular" statuses which have been recently used, and a section which shows
\fBNew...\fR and \fBSaved...\fR options for more advanced status manipulation.

.SH BUDDY POUNCE
A Buddy Pounce is an automated trigger that occurs when a buddy returns to
a normal state from an away state.  The \fBBuddy Pounce\fR dialog box
can be activated by selecting the \fIBuddy Pounce\fR option from the
\fBTools\fR menu. From this dialog, new pounces can be created with the
\fBAdd\fR button and existing pounces can be removed with the \fBDelete\fR
button.  A pounce can be set to occur on any combination of the
events listed, and any combination of actions can result.  If \fIPounce
only when my status is not Available\fR is checked, the pounce will occur
only if you are set to a non-available status, such as invisible, do not
disturb, away, etc.  If \fIRecurring\fR is checked, the pounce will remain
until removed by the \fBDelete\fR button.

.SH PLUGINS
Pidgin allows for dynamic loading of plugins to add extra functionality
to Pidgin.  Plugins can be enabled and configured from the
\fBPreferences\fR window.  See \fIplugins/HOWTO\fR or
\fIhttp://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/CHowTo\fR for more information on
writing plugins.

.SH PERL
Pidgin allows for perl scripting.  See \fIPerl Scripting HOWTO\fR in
the Pidgin documentation for more information about perl scripting.

.SH TCL
Pidgin allows for Tcl scripting. See \fIplugins/tcl/TCL-HOWTO\fR for
more information about Tcl scripting.
