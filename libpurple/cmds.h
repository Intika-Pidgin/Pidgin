/**
 * purple_cmd_register:
 * @cmd: The command. This should be a UTF-8 (or ASCII) string, with no spaces
 *            or other white space.
 * @args: A string of characters describing to libpurple how to parse this
 *        command's arguments.  If what the user types doesn't match this
 *        pattern, libpurple will keep looking for another command, unless
 *        the flag #PURPLE_CMD_FLAG_ALLOW_WRONG_ARGS is passed in @f.
 *        This string should contain no whitespace, and use a single
 *        character for each argument.  The recognized characters are:
 *        <itemizedlist>
 *          <listitem><literal>'w'</literal>: Matches a single word.</listitem>
 *          <listitem><literal>'W'</literal>: Matches a single word, with
 *                                            formatting.</listitem>
 *          <listitem><literal>'s'</literal>: Matches the rest of the
 *                                            arguments after this point,
 *                                            as a single string.</listitem>
 *          <listitem><literal>'S'</literal>: Same as <literal>'s'</literal>
 *                                            but with formatting.</listitem>
 *        </itemizedlist>
 *        If args is the empty string, then the command accepts no
 *        arguments. The args passed to the callback @func will be a %NULL
 *        terminated array of %NULL terminated strings, and will always
 *        match the number of arguments asked for, unless
 *        #PURPLE_CMD_FLAG_ALLOW_WRONG_ARGS is passed.
 * @p: This is the priority. Higher priority commands will be run first,
 *     and usually the first command will stop any others from being
 *     called.
 * @f: Flags specifying various options about this command, combined with
 *     <literal>|</literal> (bitwise OR). You need to at least pass one of
 *     #PURPLE_CMD_FLAG_IM or #PURPLE_CMD_FLAG_CHAT (you may pass both) in
 *     order for the command to ever actually be called.
 * @protocol_id: If the #PURPLE_CMD_FLAG_PROTOCOL_ONLY flag is set, this is the id
 *                of the protocol to which the command applies (such as
 *                <literal>"prpl-msn"</literal>). If the flag is not set, this
 *                parameter is ignored; pass %NULL (or a humourous string of
 *                your choice!).
 * @func: (scope call): This is the function to call when someone enters this
 *                      command.
 * @helpstr: a whitespace sensitive, UTF-8, HTML string describing how to
 *           use the command.  The preferred format of this string is the
 *           command's name, followed by a space and any arguments it
 *           accepts (if it takes any arguments, otherwise no space),
 *           followed by a colon, two spaces, and a description of the
 *           command in sentence form.  Do not include a slash before the
 *           command name.
 * @data: User defined data to pass to the #PurpleCmdFunc @f.
 *
 * Register a new command with the core.
 *
 * The command will only happen if commands are enabled,
 * which is a UI pref. UIs don't have to support commands at all.
