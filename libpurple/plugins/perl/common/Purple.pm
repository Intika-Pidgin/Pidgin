=head1 NAME

Purple - Perl extension to the libpurple instant messenger library.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Purple;

=head1 ABSTRACT

  This module provides the interface for using perl scripts as plugins
  in libpurple.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the interface for using perl scripts as plugins
in Purple. With this, developers can write perl scripts that can be
loaded in Purple as plugins. The scripts can interact with IMs, chats,
accounts, the buddy list, libpurple signals, and more.

The API for the perl interface is very similar to that of the Purple C
API, which can be viewed at https://developer.pidgin.im/doxygen/ or in
the header files in the Purple source tree.
