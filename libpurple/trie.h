/**
 * SECTION:trie
 * @include:trie.h
 * @section_id: libpurple-trie
 * @short_description: a structure for linear-time text searching
 * @title: Tries
 *
 * A #PurpleTrie is a structure for quick searching of multiple phrases within
 * a text. It's intended for repeated searches of the same set of patterns
 * within multiple source texts (or a single, big one).
 *
 * It's preparation time is <literal>O(p)</literal>, where <literal>p</literal>
 * is the total length of searched phrases. In current implementation, the
 * internal structure is invalidated after every modification of the
 * #PurpleTrie's contents, so it's not efficient to do alternating modifications
 * and searches. Search time does not depend on patterns being stored within
 * a trie and is always <literal>O(n)</literal>, where <literal>n</literal> is
 * the size of a text.
 *
 * Its main drawback is a significant memory usage - every internal trie node
 * needs about 1kB of memory on 32-bit machine and 2kB on 64-bit. Fortunately,
 * the trie grows slower when more words (with common prefixes) are added.
 * We could avoid invalidating the whole tree when altering it, but it would
 * require figuring out, how to update <literal>longest_suffix</literal> fields
 * in satisfying time.
