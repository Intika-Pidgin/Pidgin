/**
 * purple_dbus_init_ids:

 * Initializes purple dbus pointer registration engine.
 *
 * Remote dbus applications need a way of addressing objects exposed
 * by purple to the outside world.  In purple itself, these objects (such
 * as PurpleBuddy and company) are identified by pointers.  The purple
 * dbus pointer registration engine converts pointers to handles and
 * back.
 *
 * In order for an object to participate in the scheme, it must
 * register itself and its type with the engine.  This registration
 * allocates an integer id which can be resolved to the pointer and
 * back.
 *
 * Handles are not persistent.  They are reissued every time purple is
 * started.  This is not good; external applications that use purple
 * should work even whether purple was restarted in the middle of the
 * interaction.
 *
 * Pointer registration is only a temporary solution.  When PurpleBuddy
 * and similar structures have been converted into gobjects, this
 * registration will be done automatically by objects themselves.
 *
 * By the way, this kind of object-handle translation should be so
 * common that there must be a library (maybe even glib) that
 * implements it.  I feel a bit like reinventing the wheel here.
