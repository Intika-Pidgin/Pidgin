SILC Purple Plugin
==================

This is the Purple protocol plugin of the protocol called Secure Internet
Live Conferencing (SILC).  The implementation will use the SILC Toolkit,
freely available from the http://silcnet.org/ site, for the actual SILC
protocol implementation.

To include SILC into Purple, one needs to first compile and install
the SILC Toolkit.  It is done as follows:

	./configure
	make
	make install

This will compile shared libraries of the SILC Toolkit.  If the --prefix
is not given to ./configure, the binaries are installed into the
/usr/local/silc directory.

Once the Toolkit is installed one needs to tell Purple's ./configure
script where the SILC Toolkit is located.  It is done as simply as:

	./configure

if pkg-config is installed in your system.  If it is isn't it's done as:

	./configure --with-silc-libs=/path/to/silc/lib
		    --with-silc-includes=/path/to/silc/include

If the SILC Toolkit cannot be found then the SILC protocol plugin will
not be compiled.
