MySpaceIM Protocol Plugin TODO

Listed roughly in descending order of priority. 

- Setup a site for documenting my progress. A blog for updates possibly;
  definitely a wiki for the documentation. Find out best places for hosting.
[developer.pidgin.im? created a skeletal wiki page there, ok?]

- Review 0.2 code. General clean up, refactor if necessary, find out if the
  way things are done currently is the best way. Doxygen docs for each
  function, and better organization of functions.
- Win32 support. Update Makefile.mingw to match Makefile, and try compiling it.
 Email JS once complete to let know.
- Verify Nathan Peterson's documentation. Incorporate what he has that I don't
  into mine, with credit.
- Typing notifications. 
- Better buddy list support, signing on/off.
- Use Nathan Peterson's RC4 in cipher.c. Any ciphers should probably go there.
- All the TODOs and XXX's mentioned in myspace.c.
- Cosmetic: msim prpl icon.
- LEARN MONOTONE!
- Catalog all the error messages.
- Every other MySpaceIM feature not yet implemented.
