MySpaceIM Protocol Plugin 0.3     by Jeff Connelly 20070414

** Note: this code is being developed under Google Summer of Code.

Greetings. This package contains a plugin for Gaim (now named Pidgin, but
the plugin does not yet take this into consideration) to connect to the new
MySpaceIM instant messaging network and send/receive messages. Functionality
is only basic as of yet, and this code should be considered beta quality.

Currently implemented:

- Parsing most of the protocol
- Logging in using RC4/SHA1-based authentication
- Sending messages, by numeric userid, username, or email
- Receiving messages (displays username)
- Some buddy list support (show all users on buddy list as username); not stable
- Tooltip text (shows, among other things, currently playing song)
- Win32 support

To try it out, login to your account and send a message to yourself
(by your username or numeric uid (email not yet supported)) or tom (6221).
In either case you should get a reply. You should also be able to talk to
other MySpaceIM users if you desire. Replies will always be shown as coming
from a user's username, even if you IM by email or userid.

There is a lot of work still to be done:
- Better buddy list support, signing on/off
- Status (online/offline/invisible, w/ message)
- Typing notifications
- Use Nathan Peterson's RC4 in cipher.c
- General clean up of code
- All the TODOs and XXX's mentioned in myspace.c
- Every other MySpaceIM feature not yet implemented

Feedback welcome.

Enjoy,
