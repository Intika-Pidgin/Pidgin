MySpaceIM Protocol Plugin for libpurple by Jeff Connelly 2007-08-07

Greetings. This package contains a plugin for libpurple (as used in
Pidgin, formerly Gaim) to connect to the new MySpaceIM instant messaging
network and send/receive messages. Functionality is only basic as of yet,
and this code should be considered alpha quality.

This code was initially developed under Google Summer of Code 2007.

For features and TODO, see http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/MySpaceIM

Usage:

Login using your _email address_ you use to login to myspace.com. You can't
login using your numeric ID or alias.

To test it out, send a message to yourself (by your username or numeric
uid (email not yet supported)) or tom (6221). In either case you should
get a reply. You should also be able to talk to other MySpaceIM users if
you desire. Replies will always be shown as coming from a user's username,
even if you IM by email or userid.

Feedback welcome. You can IM my test account at "msimprpl" if you feel like it.

Enjoy,
-Jeff Connelly
