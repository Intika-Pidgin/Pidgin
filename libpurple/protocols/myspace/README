MySpaceIM Protocol Plugin      by Jeff Connelly 20070414

** Note: this code is being developed under Google Summer of Code.

Greetings. This package contains a plugin for libpurple (as used in
Pidgin, formerly Gaim) to connect to the new MySpaceIM instant messaging 
network and send/receive messages. Functionality is only basic as of yet, 
and this code should be considered beta quality.

For features and TODO, see http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/MySpaceIM

Login using your _email address_ you use to login to myspace.com. You can't
login using your numeric ID or alias.

To test it out, send a message to yourself (by your username or numeric 
uid (email not yet supported)) or tom (6221). In either case you should 
get a reply. You should also be able to talk to other MySpaceIM users if 
you desire. Replies will always be shown as coming from a user's username, 
even if you IM by email or userid.

There is a lot of work still to be done:
- Better buddy list support, signing on/off
- Status (online/offline/invisible, w/ message)
- Typing notifications
- General clean up of code
- All the TODOs and XXX's mentioned in myspace.c
- Every other MySpaceIM feature not yet implemented

Feedback welcome.

Enjoy,
