Pidgin and Finch: The Pimpin' Penguin IM Clients That're Good for the Soul

version 3.0.0 (??/??/????):
	General:
	* Various core components of libpurple are now GObjects (Ankit Vani).
	* Ciphers are now built from the libpurple directory.
	* Doxygen has been replaced by gtk-doc for generating documentation (Ankit
	  Vani).
	* Added dependency GPlugin, which is now required to build libpurple with
	  plugins support.
	* Added dependency gobject-introspection, which is now required to enable
	  non-native plugin support.
	* Removed flags for manually configuring GnuTLS and NSS. They are now only
	  recognized through pkg-config. (Michael McConville)
	* Fixed an issue where transient startup statuses could be deleted
	  (Jakub Adam) (#16762)

	libpurple:
	* Specify a different set of encryption ciphers for TLS connections when
	  using GnuTLS. (elrond, belmyst, and Mark Doliner) (#8061)
	* Don't allow SSL 3.0 (only TLS 1.0 and newer) for TLS connections when
	  using either GnuTLS or NSS.
	* Install a purple-url-handler file to handle protocol schemes on Linux.

	Pidgin:
	* Support building with the GTK+ 3.x toolkit.  When configuring the
	  build, use --with-gtk=<2|3> to determine which toolkit to use.  Using
	  either 2 or 3 will attempt to build with specifically 2.x or 3.x
	  support.  The default is 'auto', which will first look for 3.x
	  development headers and then 2.x development headers.
	* Add email notification in the docklet area. (Alexei) (#3571)
	* Add a pref to select the type messages in conversation that triggers
	  the docklet notification. (Momchil) (#12598)
	* Complete support for receiving a limited amount of history when
	  joining a room. (Kha) (#15458)

	* Make buddy list management code more efficient. (Oliver) (#4816)

	Bonjour:
	* Support file transfers up to ~9 EiB.

	Gadu-Gadu:
	* Possibility to require encryption. Also, using encryption when
	  available is default option now. (Tomasz Wasilczyk)
	* Show local time for incoming messages. (Tomasz Wasilczyk) (#4579)
	* Fixed password change dialog and problems with connecting to accounts
	  with non-ASCII passwords. (Tomasz Wasilczyk) (#14652)

	* The buddy's name was not centered vertically in the buddy-list if they
	  did not have a status-message or mood set.

	MySpace:
	* Remove this protocol because the servers have been taken offline.
	  (Robbie Vehse) (#15356)

	* Support file transfers up to ~9 EiB.
	* Invalid user moods can no longer be sent to the server.

	AIM:
	* Add support for the newer kerberos-based authentication of AIM 8.x

	Plugins:
	* A new plugin API has been introduced. Plugins are no longer required
	  to be of a predefined type (such as protocol, standard, loader etc),
	  and can perform multiple roles.
	* The Offline Message Emulation plugin now adds a note that the message
	  was an offline message. (Flavius Anton) (#2497)
	* Two example plugins, caesarcipher and caesarcipher_consumer, have
	  been added that demonstrate registering of a dynamic cipher type in
	  one plugin and using it in another.
	* IPC test plugins have been removed, since the new plugin API does not
	  provide a seperate IPC API.

	Protocols:
	* A single oscar plugin provides both AIM and ICQ protocols.
	* A single jabber plugin provides XMPP, GTalk and Facebook protocols.
	* A single yahoo plugin provides both Yahoo and Yahoo JAPAN protocols.

	  conversation becomes disabled or inactive. (Keith Moyer) (#12471)
	* xdg-open is now the default browser for new users on non-Windows
	  platforms. (Stanislav Brabec) (#12505)
	* The "Authorize buddy?" mini-dialog now shows the nickname of
	  the buddy requesting authorization as well as the icon of
	  the IM protocol he is using. (#5038)

	Finch:
	* Add support for drop-down account options (like the SILC cipher
	  and HMAC options or the QQ protocol version).

	XMPP:
	* Unify the connection security-related settings into one dropdown.
	* Fix a crash when multiple accounts are simultaneously performing
	  SASL authentication when built with Cyrus SASL support.  (thanks
	  to Jan Kaluza) (#11560)

	  Stream ID. (#12331)
	* Added support for using Google's relay servers when making voice and
	  video calls to Google clients.
	* Fix detecting file transfer proxies advertised by the server.
	* Advertise support for Google Talk's JID Domain Discovery extension
	  in all cases again (changed in 2.7.0), not just when the domain
	  is "gmail.com" or "googlemail.com" (it's also needed for Google
	  Talk used for accounts on arbitrary domains not using Google Apps
	  for Your Domain). (#a14153)
	* Improved handling of adding oneself to your buddy list when using
	  Non-SASL (legacy) authentication. (#12499)
	* Generate a connection error instead of just stalling when the
	  _xmppconnect TXT record returns results, but none of them result
	  in a valid BOSH URI. (#a14367, #12744)

	AIM and ICQ:
	* Add support for managing Visible/Invisible lists. (#10967)
	* Fix a problem with receiving HTML messages from

	* Don't set a custom status text when going Invisible to avoid
	  being detected as Invisible. (#10633)

	Yahoo/Yahoo JAPAN:
	* Stop doing unnecessary lookups of certain alias information.  This
	  solves deadlocks when a given Yahoo account has a ridiculously large
	  (>500 buddies) list and may improve login speed for those on slow
	  connections. (#12532)
	* Fix sending SMS messages.  The lookup host changed on us.  (Thanks to
	  todo) (#12688).
	* Improvements for some file transfer scenarios, but not all.

	  request with an icon.  Fixes receiving MSN file transfer requests
	  including a thumbnail in Finch.

	* Add support for the Gadu-Gadu protocol in the gevolution plugin to
	  provide Evolution integration with contacts with GG IDs. (#10709)
	* Remap the "Set User Mood" shortcut to Control-D, which does not
	  conflict with the previous shortcut for Get Buddy Info on the
	  selected buddy.
	* Add a plugin action menu (under Tools) for the Voice and Video
	  Settings plugin.

	Finch:
	* Add support for drop-down account options (like the SILC cipher
	  and HMAC options or the QQ protocol version).

	XMPP:
	* Unify the connection security-related settings into one dropdown.
	* Fix a crash when multiple accounts are simultaneously performing
	  SASL authentication when built with Cyrus SASL support.  (thanks

	  Stream ID. (#12331)
	* Added support for using Google's relay servers when making voice and
	  video calls to Google clients.

	Yahoo/Yahoo JAPAN:
	* Stop doing unnecessary lookups of certain alias information.  This
	  solves deadlocks when a given Yahoo account has a ridiculously large
	  (>500 buddies) list and may improve login speed for those on slow
	  connections. (#12532)

version 2.7.3 (08/10/2010):
	General:
	* Use silent build rules for automake >1.11. You can enable verbose
	  builds with the --disable-silent-rules configure option, or using
	  make V=1.

	libpurple:
	* Fix the TURN server settings (broken in 2.7.0).

	Pidgin:
	* Re-focus the input area after clicking the attention toolbar button.
	* Re-arrange media window to make it more netbook-friendly.

	Finch:
	* Rebindable 'suggest-next-page' and 'suggest-prev-page' actions for

	MSN:
	* Support for web-based buddy icons, used when a buddy logs in to the
	  messenger on the Live website.
	* Fix file transfers with some clients that don't support direct
	  connections (e.g., papyon, telepathy-butterfly, etc.) (#12150)

	MXit:
	* Fix filename for the Shocked emoticon. (#12364)
	* Implement the new naming conventions where possible. (MXitId, etc)
	* Display a message in the Groupchat window when you invite somebody.
	* Birthday field in profile cannot be edited when server says it is
	  locked.
	* If a buddy is offline, show in their profile when last they were online.
	* Handle pushed profile update packets (ie, when changing your avatar via
	  the Gallery bot).
	* If a buddy is offline and we see from their profile that they have
	  updated their avatar, request the new avatar image from the server.
	* Fix a possible crash if a link is clicked while disconnected.
	* Unescape any escaped characters in a chatroom nickname.
	* Add the new MXit moods and emoticons.
	* MXit emoticons added to the small emoticon theme.

	XMPP:
	* Allow connecting to servers that only advertise GSSAPI and expect
	  a fallback to legacy IQ authentication (broken in 2.7.0).
	* Fix a crash when receiving custom emoticons that don't adhere to
	  the specification.
	* When initiating a file transfer, don't show resources that are certain
	  to not support file transfers in the resource selection dialog.
	* Fix connecting to servers using BOSH and authenticating with
	  DIGEST-MD5 when libpurple was built with Cyrus SASL support.

	Yahoo/Yahoo JAPAN:
	* Renamed "Use account proxy for SSL connections" to "Use account proxy
	  for HTTP and HTTPS requests" and tied the option to HTTP requests too.
	* Properly detect HTTP proxy server use when the HTTP proxy is the
	  global proxy server, an account-level non-HTTP proxy server is
	  configured, and the "Use account proxy for HTTP and HTTPS requests"
	  account option is turned off.  This fixes connecting for some HTTP
	  proxy servers.
	* Fall back to connecting to scsa.msg.yahoo.com (not configurable) if
	  the HTTP-based connect server lookup fails.  This does not work for
	  Yahoo JAPAN accounts.

	  begin".

version 2.7.2 (07/21/2010):
	AIM and ICQ:

	  remote users.  This is CVE-2010-2528.
	* Fix a rare crash bug caused by certain incoming SMS messages
	  (discovered by Jan Kaluza--thanks Jan!).
	* Change HTML sent from ICQ accounts so that official ICQ clients
	  hopefully display it correctly.

	MSN:
	* Fix a crash related to fast buddy icon transfers.

version 2.7.1 (05/29/2010):
	General:
	* Build fixes on OpenSolaris.  (Brian Lu)
	* Add configure option --enable-trayicon-compat which installs tray
	  icons into directories that are compatible with older versions of
	  hicolor-icon-theme (0.9).

	Pidgin:
	* Restore the tray icon's blinking functionality.
	* Fix a crash setting moods when an account is disconnected.

	MXit:
	* Replace the MXit-specific mood management with the new standard Moods
	  API.
	* Add the standard MXit emoticons.
	* Improve the handling of users being kicked from MultiMX rooms.
	* MXit doesn't allow you to see your buddy's Email Address or Title,
	  so remove those two fields from the "Buddy Information" page.
	* Show buddy's Registration Country in their profile.
	* Increment protocol version to v6.0
	* If an invite you sent was rejected with a reason, display that
	  message in the buddy tooltip.

	  (Resolves issue on Maemo)
	* When your avatar image is changed, don't forget the user's profile
	  information.

	  to work.

version 2.7.0 (05/12/2010):
	General:
	* Changed GTK+ minimum version requirement to 2.10.0.
	* Changed GLib minimum version requirement to 2.12.0.
	* Using the --disable-nls argument to configure now works properly.
	  You will no longer be forced to have intltool to configure and build.
	* Fix two related crashes in the GnuTLS and NSS plugins when they
	  suffer internal errors immediately upon attempting to establish
	  an SSL connection.
	* Fix NSS to work when reinitialized after being used.  (Thanks to
	  Ludovico Cavedon for the testcase)
	* Added support for PURPLE_GNUTLS_PRIORITIES environment variable.
	  This can be used to specify GnuTLS priorities on a per-host basis.
	  The format is "host=priority;host2=priority;...".  The default
	  priority can be overridden by using "*" as the host.  See the
	  GnuTLS manual for documentation on the format of the priority
	  strings.
	* Fix autoconf detection of Python.  (Brad Smith)
	* Fix a crash when a Windows proxy (from IE) does not have a port.

	  box to a "Developer Information" dialog accessible on the Help menu.
	* Moved the Translator information from the About box to a "Translator
	  Information" dialog accessible on the Help menu.
	* Use GtkStatusIcon for the docklet, providing better integration in
	  notification area.
	* Added UI for sending attentions (buzz, nudge) on supporting protocols.
	* Make the search dialog unobtrusive in the conversation window (by
	  making it look and behave like the search dialog in Firefox)
	* The Recent Log Activity sort method for the Buddy List now
	  distinguishes between no activity and a small amount of activity
	  in the distant past.  (Greg McNew)
	* Added a menu set mood globally for all mood-supporting accounts
	  (currently XMPP and ICQ).
	* Default binding of Ctrl+Shift+v to 'Paste as Plain Text' in
	  conversation windows. This can be changed in .gtkrc-2.0. For example,
	  Ctrl+v can be bound to 'Paste as Plain Text' by default.
	* Plugins can now handle markup in buddy names by attaching to the
	  "drawing-buddy" signal. (Daniele Ricci, Andrea Piccinelli)
	* Be more accommodating when scaling down large images for use as
	  buddy icons.
	* The 'Message Timestamp Formats' plugin allows changing the timestamp
	  format from the timestamps' context menu in conversation log.
	* The 'Message Timestamp Formats' plugin allows forcing 12-hour
	  timestamps.  (Jonathan Maltz)
	* Fix pastes from Chrome (rich-text pastes and probably URLs
	  having garbage appended to them).
	* Show file transfer thumbnails for images on supporting protocols
	  (currently only supported on MSN).

	Bonjour:
	* Added support for IPv6. (Thanks to T_X for testing)

	Gadu-Gadu:
	* Updated our bundled libgadu to 1.9.0-rc2 (many thanks to Krzysztof
	  Klinikowski for the work and testing put in here!)
	* Minimum requirement for external libgadu is now also 1.9.0-rc2.

	AIM and ICQ:
	* X-Status (Custom ICQ status icon) support.  Since most of the icons
	  available reflect moods, this is labeled "Set Mood" on the
	  Accounts->ICQ Account menu. (Andrew Ivanov, TomÃ¡Å¡ Kebert,
	  Yuriy Yevgrafov, and trac users bob007, salieff, and nops)
	* Allow setting and displaying icons between 1x1 and 100x100 pixels for
	  ICQ.  Previously only icons between 48x48 and 52x64 were allowed.
	* When using the clientLogin authentication method, prompt for a
	  password on reconnect when "Remember Password" is not checked and
	  authentication fails due to an incorrect password.  (This is the same
	  behavior as the legacy authentication method)
	* Support sending and receiving HTML-formatted messages for ICQ.
	* Use the proper URL for "View web profile" link for ICQ buddies.
	  (Alexander Nartov)

	MSN:
	* Support for version 9 of the MSN protocol has been removed.  This
	  version is no longer supported on the servers.
	* Support file transfer thumbnails (previews) for images.
	* Fix CVE-2010-1624 (custom emoticon remote crash).

	XMPP:
	* Direct messages to a specific resource only upon receipt of a message
	  with content (as opposed to a typing notification, etc).  (Thanks to
	  rjoly for testing)
	* Present a better error message when authentication fails while trying
	  to connect to Facebook.  (David Reiss, Facebook)
	* When sending data using in-band-bytestreams, interpret the block-size
	  attribute as the size of the BASE64-encoded representation of the
	  data.
	* Validate the hash on incoming BoB data objects (for custom smileys
	  etc.), cache based per JID when the CID is not a valid hash (as
	  specified by the BoB XEP).
	* Send whitespace keepalives if we haven't sent data in a while (2
	  minutes).  This fixes an issue with Openfire disconnecting a
	  libpurple-baesd client that has just been quiet for about 6
	  minutes.
	* Only support Google Talk's JID Domain Discovery extension
	  (allowing a user to log in with "@gmail.com" or "@googlemail.com"
	  interchangeably) for those two domains.  This change was made
	  due to interoperability issues with some BOSH Connection Managers
	  and namespaced attributes.

	Yahoo/Yahoo JAPAN:
	* Attempt to better handle transparent proxies interfering with
	  HTTP-based login.
	* Fix handling of P2P packets, thus fixing the loss of some messages.
	* Retrieve the pager server address from Yahoo!'s servers directly.
	* Removed the "Pager server" account option, as it is no longer needed.
	* The authentication code is now less order-sensitive with the
	  components of the server's response.
	* The authentication process now acts more like the official client.

	* Minimum required GTK+ version increased to 2.14.7
	* Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows ME
	  (Millennium Edition), and Windows NT 4.0 longer supported due to GTK+
	  requirements changes.
	* Crash Report files (pidgin.RPT) are now generated in the ~/.purple
	  directory instead of the installation directory.
	* NSS SSL Library upgraded to 3.12.5 (thanks to Berke Viktor)
	* GtkSpell upgraded to 2.0.16, changing the spellchecking backend to
	  enchant.  This means that myspell and hunspell (OpenOffice)
	  dictionaries can be used (previous versions' aspell dictionaries
	  will not work).

version 2.6.6 (02/18/2010):
	libpurple:
	* Fix 'make check' on OS X. (David Fang)
	* Fix a quirk in purple_markup_html_to_xhtml that caused some messages
	  to be improperly converted to XHTML.
	* Set "controlling-mode" correctly when initializing a media session.
	  Fixes receiving voice calls from Psi.
	* When looking up DNS records, use the type of record returned by the
	  server (instead of the type we asked for) to determine how to process
	  the record.
	* Fix an issue with parsing XML attributes that contain "&lt;br&gt;".
	  See ChangeLog.API for more details.

	General:
	* Correctly disable all missing dependencies when using the
	  --disable-missing-dependencies option.  (Gabriel Schulhof)

	Gadu-Gadu:
	* Fix display of avatars after a server-side change. (Krzysztof
	  Klinikowski)

	AIM:
	* Allow setting and displaying icons between 1x1 and 100x100 pixels.
	  Previously only icons between 48x48 and 50x50 were allowed.

	MSN:
	* Fix CVE-2010-0277, a possible remote crash when parsing an incoming
	  SLP message.  (Discovered by Fabian Yamaguchi)
	* File transfer requests will no longer cause a crash if you delete the
	  file before the other side accepts.
	* Received files will no longer hold an extra lock after completion,
	  meaning they can be moved or deleted without complaints from your OS.
	* Buddies who sign in from a second location will no longer cause an
	  unnecessary chat window to open.
	* Support setting an animated GIF as a buddy icon.
	* Numerous code cleanups and memory savings.

	MySpace:
	* Fix a leak and crash when retrieving buddy icons.

	XMPP:
	* Less likely to send messages to a contact's idle/inactive resource.
	  Previously, if a message was received from a specific resource,
	  responses would be sent to that resource until either it went offline
	  or a message is received from another resource.  Now, messages are
	  sent to the bare JID upon receipt of any presence change from the
	  contact.
	* Added support for the SCRAM-SHA-1 SASL mechanism.  This is only
	  available when built without Cyrus SASL support.
	* When getting info on a domain-only (server) JID, show uptime
	  (when given by the result of the "last query") and don't show status
	  as offline.
	* Fix getting info on your own JID.
	* Wrap XHTML messages in <p>, as described in XEP-0071, for
	  compatibility with some clients.
	* Don't do an SRV lookup for a STUN server associated with the account
	  if one is already set globally in prefs.
	* Don't send custom smileys larger than the recommended maximum object
	  size specified in the BoB XEP.   This prevents a client from being
	  disconnected by servers that dislike overly-large stanzas.
	* Fix receiving messages without markup over an Openfire BOSH
	  connection (forcibly put the stanzas in the jabber:client namespace).
	* The default value for the file transfer proxies is automatically
	  updated when an account connects, if it is still the old (broken)
	  default (from 'proxy.jabber.org' to 'proxy.eu.jabber.org').
	* Fix an issue where libpurple created duplicate buddies if the roster
	  contains a buddy in two groups that differ only by case
	  (e.g. "XMPP" and "xmpp") (or not at all).

	Yahoo:
	* Don't send <span> and </span> tags.  (Fartash Faghri)
	* Support PingBox.  PingBoxes will appear as pbx/PingBoxName.  (Kartik
	  Mohta)

	Pidgin:
	* Fix CVE-2010-0423, a denial of service attack due to the parsing
	  of large numbers of smileys.  (Discovered by Antti Hayrynen)
	* Correctly size conversation and status box entries when the
	  interior-focus style property is diabled. (Gabriel Schulhof)
	* Correctly handle a multiline text field being required in a
	  request form.  (Thanks to Florian Zeitz for finding this problem)
	* Search friends by email-addresses in the buddy list. (Luoh Ren-Shan)
	* Allow dropping an image on Custom Smiley window to add a new one.
	* Prompt for confirmation when clearing a whiteboard (doodle) session.
	  (Kartik Mohta)
	* Use the "hand" cursor when hovering over usernames in chat history to
	  indicate that the username is an actionable item.
	* Double-clicking usernames in chat history will open an IM with that
	  user.
	* Put an icon on the "Filter" button in the debug window.
	* Don't treat "/messages/like/this " as commands.
	* Explicitly mark user interaction when inserting smilies from the
	  toolbar so "Undo" correctly removes these smilies.
	* Clicking "New" or "Saved" in the status selector menu while typing a
	  status message no longer keeps the status entry area stuck in "typing"
	  mode forever.
	* Show tooltips for ellipsized conversation tabs.  On older systems,
	  tooltips will show for all tabs.
	* The File Transfers and Debug Window windows are no longer created as
	  dialogs.  These windows should now have minimize buttons in many
	  environments in which they were previously missing
	  (including Windows).
	* Smiley themes with Windows line endings no longer cause theme
	  descriptions not to be displayed in the theme selector.

	Finch:
	* Fix CVE-2010-0420, a possible remote crash when handling chat room
	  buddy names.
	* Rebindable 'move-first' and 'move-last' actions for tree widgets. So
	  it is possible to jump to the first or last entry in the buddy list
	  (and other such lists) by pressing home or end key (defaults)
	  respectively.

version 2.6.5 (01/08/2010):
	libpurple:
	* TLS certificates are actually stored to the local cache once again
	  (accepting a name mismatch on a certificate should now be remembered)

	General:
	* Build-time fixes for Solaris.  (Paul Townsend)

	AIM and ICQ:
	* Messages from some mobile clients are no longer displayed as
	  Chinese characters (broken in 2.6.4)

	MSN:
	* Fix an issue allowing a remote user to download arbitrary files from
	  a libpurple client.  (CVE-2010-0013)

	XMPP:
	* Do not crash when attempting to register for a new account on Windows.
	* Fix file transfer with clients that do not support Entity Capabilities
	  (e.g. Spark)

	libpurple:
	* Actually emit the hold signal for media calls.
	* Fix building the GnuTLS plugin with older versions of GnuTLS.
	* Fix DNS TXT query resolution.
	* Don't send Proxy-Authorization headers to HTTP proxy servers until
	  we've received a "407 Proxy Authentication Required" response from
	  the server.  (thecrux)
	* Added "MXit" protocol plugin, supported and maintained by the MXit
	  folks themselves (MXit Lifestyle (Pty) Ltd.)

	General:
	* New 'plugins' sub-command to 'debug' command (i.e. '/debug plugins')
	  to announce the list of loaded plugins (in both Finch and Pidgin).
	* Always rejoin open chats after an account reconnects.

	AIM and ICQ:
	* Better rate limit calculations and other improvements.  (Aman Gupta)

	* Fix a random crash that might occur when idle.
	* Fix a crash when logging in with some long non-ASCII passwords.
	  (Shaun Lindsay)
	* Cache our own friendly name as the server no longer does that for
	  us.  Users of older versions may need to re-set their friendly name
	  as it has probably been reset.

	XMPP:
	* Users connecting to Google Talk now have an "Initiate Chat" context
	  menu option for their buddies.  (Eion Robb)
	* Fix a crash when attempting to validate an invalid JID.
	* Resolve an issue when connecting to iChat Server when no resource
	  is specified.
	* Try to automatically find a STUN server by using an SRV lookup on the
	  account's domain, and use that for voice and video if found and the
	  user didn't set one manually in prefs.
	* Fix a crash when adding a buddy without an '@'.
	* Don't show the option to send a file to a buddy if we know for certain
	  they don't support any file transfer method supported by libpurple.
	* Keep the avatar on the server if one is not set locally.

	Yahoo:
	* Fix sending /buzz.
	* Fix blocking behavior for federated (MSN/OCS/Sametime) service users.

	  as "ocs/user@domain.tld" and Sametime users are added as
	  "ibm/sametime_id".  (Jason Cohen)

	Finch:
	* The TinyURL plugin now creates shorter URLs for long non-conversation
	  URLs, e.g. URLs to open Inbox in Yahoo/MSN protocols, or the Yahoo
	  Captcha when joining chat rooms.
	* Fix displaying umlauts etc. in non-utf8 locale (fix in libgnt).

	Pidgin:
	* The userlist in a multiuser chat can be styled via gtkrc by using the
	  widget name "pidgin_conv_userlist". (Heiko Schmitt)
	* Add a hold button to the media window.
	* Fix a bug where the conversation backlog stops scrolling in a very
	  busy chat room.
	* In the Conversation "Send To" menu, offline buddies appear grayed
	  out (but are still selectable).  Previously, only offline buddies on
	  accounts that do not support offline messaging appeared grayed out.

	Pidgin Preference and Preference Window Changes:
	* Removed the "Use font from theme" and "Conversation Font" preferences
	  for everyone except Windows users.  The font can be controlled from
	  the Pidgin GTK+ Theme Control plugin.
	* Tabs in the Preferences window are now on the left side.
	* The Browser tab is now visible for GNOME users.
	* Added a Proxy tab shown no matter what environment Pidgin runs in.
	* The Browser and Proxy tabs show appropriate GNOME-specific messages
	  and allow launching the correct applications to change the relevant

	  0 and 9 (higher is more verbose). Higher values may reveal sensitive
	  information.
	* PURPLE_VERBOSE_DEBUG environment variable.  Currently, this is an "on"

version 2.5.7 (06/20/2009):
	* Yahoo Protocol 16 support, including new HTTPS login method; this should

	  configured command is invalid. (Michael Terry)

	Pidgin:
	* On GTK+ 2.14 and higher, we're using the gtk-tooltip-delay setting
	  instead of our own (hidden) tooltip_delay pref.  If you had
	  previously changed that pref, add a line like this to
	  ~/.purple/gtkrc-2.0 (where 500 is the timeout (in ms) you want):
	      gtk-tooltip-timeout = 500
	  To completely disable tooltips (e.g. if you had an old
	  tooltip_delay of zero), add this to ~/.purple/gtkrc-2.0:
	      gtk-enable-tooltips = 0
	* Moved the release notification dialog to a mini-dialog in the
	  buddylist. (Casey Ho)
	* Fix a crash when closing an authorization minidialog with the X
	  then immediately going offline. (Paul Aurich)
	* Fix a crash cleaning up custom smileys when Pidgin is closed.
	* Fix adding a custom smiley using the context menu in a conversation
	  if no custom smilies have previously been added using the smiley
	  manager.
	* Improved support for some message formatting in conversations.
	* Allow focusing the conversation history or userlist with F6.
	* Fixed the Send Button plugin to avoid duplicate buttons in a single
	  conversation.
	* Double-clicking a saved status will now activate it and close the
	  saved status manager, rather than edit the status.

	Finch:
	* Allow binding meta+arrow keys for actions.
	* Added default meta+erase binding for delete previous word.
	* Added "Show When Offline" to buddy menus, so a plugin is no longer
	  needed.

version 2.5.2 (10/19/2008):
	libpurple:
	* Fixed a crash on removing a custom buddy icon on a buddy.
	* Fixed a crash caused by certain self-signed SSL certificates.
	* Enable a number of strong ciphers which were previously disabled
	  when using NSS.  (Thanks to Marcus Trautwig.)

	Pidgin:
	* The status selector now saves your message when changing status.
	* Fix a case where a conversation window could close unexpectedly.
	* A mute sounds option has been added to the preferences window to
	  help with discoverability.  CTRL+S is no longer bound to mute.
	* Added ability to change the color of visited links (using the theme
	  control plugin, or setting the color in ~/.gtkrc-2.0)
	* Fix a crash occuring when a custom smiley is deleted and re-added and
	  used in an open conversation after being re-added.

	Finch:
	* A new 'Nested Grouping' option in the 'Grouping' plugin. Group
	  hierarchies are defined by the '/' character in the group names.
	* A bug was fixed where some key-bindings wouldn't work with some TERMs
	  (e.g. xterm-color, screen-linux etc.)

	MSN:
	* Operations (such as moving to a new group) on contacts that were added
	  in the same session should now complete correctly, and not cause
	  synchronization errors at next login.
	* Minor fixes to login process during a server transfer.
	* Restored the "Has You" feature to the MSN protocol tooltips.
	* ADL 205/214/etc errors should no longer prevent login.

	XMPP:
	* Sending and receiving custom smileys using the specification in
	  XEP-0231 (bits of binary) and XHTML-IM

	Yahoo:
	* Only send a Ping once every hour.  This prevents the account from
	  being disconnected from the server periodically.

version 2.5.1 (08/30/2008):
	libpurple:
	* In the Join/Part plugin, add the ability to apply the rules to
	  buddies.  By default, joins and parts for buddies are still shown.
	* Support SOCKS proxies specified in GNOME or Windows proxy settings.
	* Fix some possible crashes in MSNP15.
	* Enable a default SSL trust relationship for MSN servers.
	* Avoid disconnecting from XMPP servers on parse errors that are
	  non-fatal.
	* Include some perl files that were mistakenly omitted in 2.5.0.

	Pidgin:
	* Prevent use of custom smilies without "shortcuts."
	* Fix a crash that could appear with AIM buddy tooltips.

	Artwork:
	* General refresh of many icons in the interface.
	* Many cleanups to artwork source are now included in the distribution.
	* A new "throbber" animation has been added to indicate when accounts
	  are connecting.

version 2.5.0 (08/18/2008):
	libpurple:
	* Ability to create custom smileys (currently only the MSN protocol
	  utilizes the feature). (Thanks to Mauro SÃ©rgio Ferreira Brasil,
	  Marcus Lundblad, Jorge VillaseÃ±or and other contributors)
	* Add a configure option, --with-system-ssl-certs to allow packagers
	  to specify a system-wide SSL CA certificates directory.  When set,
	  we don't install our SSL CA certs, so it's important that the
	  libpurple package depend on the CA certificates.
	* Add SSL Certificates support to the NSS SSL plugin. (Thanks to Lou
	  Cipher)

	XMPP:
	* Fix a bug that caused the UI to not refresh and caused the client
	  to use 99% CPU when an XMPP account lost its connection to the
	  server.
	* Possibly fix a bug where some clients could get into a state
	  where they moved a buddy back and forth between two groups in
	  an endless loop.

	IRC:
	* /ctcp command (Vladislav GuberiniÄ)
	* Allow for auto-detection of incoming UTF-8 formatted text on
	  accounts which are configured to use some other encoding.

	MSN:
	* Update MSN support to protocol 15 (Elliott Sales de Andrade, Jorge
	  VillaseÃ±or, Mike Ruprecht, Carlos Silva, Ma Yuan, Daniel Ljungborg
	  and others)
	* Personal messages are now supported. They are treated as status
	  messages.
	* Offline IM is now supported.
	* Aliasing is now supported server-side.
	* Buddies are now emblemed. Bots and web clients should now be
	  distinguished.
	* Update smiley set for non-faces.
	* Failing to update a buddy icon when the buddy has gone offline no
	  longer crashes.
	* Custom smileys received in a chat no longer go to a new window.
	* Processing is no longer completely frozen after the servers block a
	  message because it contains (what they consider) inappropriate text.

	Pidgin:
	* Custom buddy icons can now be added to and removed from buddy list
	  entries via the buddy list entry right-click menu.
	* Resize large incoming custom smileys to a maximum of 96px on either
	  side.
	* Offer to add new buddies into the same contact as existing buddies
	  in the same group if the alias given is the same.
	* Minor smiley style update.

	General:
	* Group and Chat buddy list entries can now be given custom buddy
	  icons.

	Finch:
	* Added "Invite..." menu to chats.
	* Added "View All Logs" menu in the buddylist to display a list of all IM
	  logs.
	* Added '/msgcolor' command to change colors of different classes of
	  messages in a conversation. See '/help msgcolor' for details.
	* Added tab-completion for commands in conversation windows.

version 2.4.3 (07/01/2008):
	libpurple:
	* Yahoo! Japan now uses UTF-8, matching the behavior of official clients
	  and restoring compatibility with the web messenger (Yusuke Odate)
	* Setting your buddy icon once again works for Yahoo! accounts.
	* Fixes in the Yahoo! protocol to prevent a double free, crashes on
	  aliases, and alias functionality
	* Fix crashes in the bonjour protocol
	* Always use UTF-8 for Yahoo! (#5973)
	* Fix a crash when the given jabber id is invalid.
	* Make the IRC "unknown message" debugging messages UTF-8 safe.
	* Fix connecting to ICQ
	* Fix a memleak when handling jabber xforms.

	Pidgin:
	* Include the send button plugin in the win32 build
	* Various memory leak fixes

version 2.4.2 (05/17/2008):
	https://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.4.2
	libpurple:
	* In MySpaceIM, messages from spambots are discarded (Justin Williams)
	* Strip mIRC formatting codes from quit and part messages.
	* IRC now displays ban lists in-channel for joined channels.
	* Fixed a bug where the list of loaded plugins would get removed when
	  switching between different operating systems.
	* Fix reception of IRC PART without a part message on Undernet
	  (fixes a problem with litter in the channel user list).
	* IRC no longer crashes on /list on servers which erroneously omit
	  RPL_LISTSTART.
	* Update the NetworkManager support to use D-Bus directly, instead of
	  libnm-glib.  Hopefully it's stable now.  It will now compile by
	  default if you have D-Bus support and NetworkManager.h. (Elliott
	  Sales de Andrade)
	* MSN buddy list synchronization is now more forgiving, only asking
	  about buddies who have disappeared completely from the server list
	  and not those that have simply moved groups.
	* IRC will now try to append 1-9 to your nick if it is in use, instead
	  of substituting the last character with 1-9 where possible.
	* Bonjour buddies will be saved persistently if they're moved out of
	  the "Bonjour" group. (Eion Robb)

	Pidgin:
	* The typing notification in the conversation history can be disabled or
	  customized (font, color etc.) in .gtkrc-2.0.
	* Added a plugin (not installed by default) which adds a Send button
	  back to the conversation window. People without physical keyboards
	  have a hard time with the lack of the button.
	* Clicking on the buddyicon in the conversation window toggles the
	  size of the icon between small and large.
	* The settings of a chat (e.g. Handle in an XMPP chat, or Exchange in
	  an AIM chat) can be edited from its context menu in the buddy list.
	* Add a "Present conversation window" preference to the Message
	  Notification plugin; the "Raise conversation window" option does not
	  unminimize windows or draw attention to them when they are on other
	  workspaces--the "Present" option should.
	* Add a preference to set Escape as the keyboard shortcut for closing
	  the conversation window.
	* Add an option in the context menu to disable smileys in the selected
	  text in the conversation history/log viewer. This should help people
	  who regularly paste code in conversations.
	* Add a preference to choose the minimum size of the text input area in
	  lines.
	* Moved the "Local alias" field in the Modify Account dialog to be below
	  the "User Options" heading on the "Basic" tab.
	* Number of room occupants is now shown in chat tooltips where possible

	General:
	* The configure script now dies on more absent dependencies.  The
	  --disable-xxx arguments to configure can be used to bypass unneeded
	  dependencies.  This will also cause the configure script to die if an
	  --enable-xxx option is used and the dependencies it requires are
	  missing.
	* The Evolution integration plugin must now be explicitly enabled.  Use
	  the --enable-gevolution argument to configure to enable it.
	* The Contact Availability Prediction plugin must now be explicitly
	  enabled.  Use the --enable-cap argument to configure to enable it.

	Finch:
	* New default binding ctrl+x to open context menus.
	* Menu triggers and other bindings will no longer conflict.
	* Middle click pastes the internal clipboard (when mouse support is
	  enabled).

version 2.4.1 (03/31/2008):
	https://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.4.1

	libpurple:
	* Treat AIM Unicode messages as UTF-16 rather than UCS-2; this
	  should have no functional effect, other than continued support
	  on systems which have dropped UCS-2 conversions.
	* Add support for setting buddy icons on Gadu-Gadu (Tomasz Salacinski)
	* Fix a crash when clearing the buddy icon for an account on XMPP
	* Fix a crash during login for some ICQ accounts
	* Prefer more available resources on XMPP when priorities are equal
	* Fix incorrectly marking some Yahoo! contacts as blocked
	* Improved handling of UTF-8 group names on ICQ (beret)
	* Fix a crash when starting if you have a Zephyr account
	* Increase XMPP ping timeout to 120 seconds, to prevent poor network
	  connections from timing out unnecessarily.
	* Don't crash on XMPP forms with empty default values.
	* Fix issues with CHAP authentication for SOCKS5 proxies.

	Pidgin:
	* Remove a workaround for older versions gstreamer that was causing
	  crashes on some non-Linux systems such as HPUX
	* Fix some cases of the conversation input entry area being 1 pixel high
	* Fix for displaying channel & buddy names in conversation window when
	  they have '&' in them
	* Some memory leak fixes, especially in the Text Replacement plugin
	* Rectangular but non-square buddy icons have rounded corners in the buddy
	  list

	Finch:
	* Fix compiling with Glib older than 2.6
	* Ensure existing conversations selected from the 'Send IM' dialog are
	  given focus
	* Move the tooltip on the left of the buddylist if there's not enough room
	  on the right to show it.

	https://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.4.0

	libpurple:
	* Added support for offline messages for AIM accounts (thanks to
	  Matthew Goldstein)
	* Fixed various problems with loss of status messages when going
	  or returning from idle on MySpaceIM.
	* Eliminated unmaintained Howl backend implementation for the
	  Bonjour protocol.  Avahi (or Apple's Bonjour runtime on win32) is
	  now required to use Bonjour.
	* Partial support for viewing ICQ status notes (Collin from
	  ComBOTS GmbH).
	* Support for /notice on IRC.
	* Support for Yahoo! Messenger 7.0+ file transfer method (Thanumalayan S.)
	* Support for retrieving full names and addresses from the address book
	  on Yahoo! Japan (Yusuke Odate)
	* The AIM/ICQ server-side preference for "allow others to see me
	  as idle" is no longer unconditionally set to "yes" even when
	  your libpurple preference is "no."

	* D-Bus fixes on 64bit
	* Fixed retrieval of buddy icons and setting of server-side aliases on
	  Yahoo! and Yahoo! Japan when using an HTTP proxy server (Gideon N.
	  Guillen)
	* Fixed an MSN bug that would leave you appearing offline when transferred
	  to different server

	Pidgin:
	* Added the ability to theme conversation name colors (red and blue)
	  through your GTK+ theme, and exposed those theme settings to the
	  Pidgin GTK+ Theme Control plugin (Dustin Howett)
	* Fixed having multiple alias edit areas in the infopane (Elliott Sales
	  de Andrade)
	* Save the conversation "Enable Logging" option per-contact (Moos
	  Heintzen)
	* Typing notifications are now shown in the conversation area

	Finch:
	* Color is used in the buddylist to indicate status, and the conversation
	  window to indicate various message attributes. Look at the sample gntrc
	  file in the man page for details.
	* The default keybinding for dump-screen is now M-D and uses a file
	  request dialog. M-d will properly delete-forward-word, and M-f has been
	  fixed to imitate readline's behavior.
	* New bindings alt+tab and alt+shift+tab to help navigating between the
	  higlighted windows (details on the man page).
	* Recently signed on (or off) buddies blink in the buddy list.
	* New action 'Room List' in the action list can be used to get the list of
	  available chat rooms for an online account.
	* The 'Grouping' plugin can be used for alternate grouping in the
	  buddylist. The current options are 'Group Online/Offline' and 'No
	  Group'.
	* Added a log viewer
	* Added the ability to block/unblock buddies - see the buddy context menu
	  and the menu for the buddy list.
	* Fixed a bug preventing finch working on x86_64

version 2.3.1 (12/7/2007):
	https://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.3.1
		NOTE: Due to the way this release was made, it is possible that
		      bugs marked as fixed in 2.3.1 will not be fixed until the
		      next release.

	* Fixed a number of MSN bugs introduced in 2.3.0, resolving problems
	  connecting to MSN and random local display name changes
	* Going idle on MySpaceIM will no longer clear your status and message.
	* Idle MySpaceIM buddies should now appear online at login.
	* Fixed crashes in XMPP when discovering a client's capabilities
	* Don't set the current tune title if it's NULL (XMPP/Google Talk)
	* Don't allow buddies to be manually added to Bonjour
	* Don't advertise IPv6 on Bonjour because we don't support it
	* Compile fixes for FreeBSD and Solaris
	* Update QQ client version so some accounts can connect again
	* Do not allow ISON requests to stack in IRC, preventing flooding IRC
	  servers when temporary network outages are restored
	* Plug several leaks in the perl plugin loader
	* Prevent autoaccept plugin overwriting existing files

version 2.3.0 (11/24/2007):
	https://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.3.0
		NOTE: Some bugs marked fixed in 2.2.1, 2.2.2 or 2.2.3 may not
		      have been fixed until this release (2.3.0).

	libpurple:
	* Real usernames are now shown in the system log.
	* We now honor a PURPLE_DISABLE_DEPRECATED define to allow plugins to
	  catch deprecated functions earlier rather than later.
	* Thanks to a patch from Intel, the Bonjour prpl now supports file
	  transfers using XEP-0096 and XEP-0065.  This should enable file
	  transfers between libpurple clients and Gajim clients, but will not
	  work with iChat or Adium as they use a different file transfer
	  implementation.
	* XMPP password changes that return errors no longer cause the saved
	  password to be changed.
	* XMPP file transfer support has been enhanced to support sending
	  files through a proxy when the server supports discovering a
	  a bytestream proxy.  This should make file transfers much more
	  reliable.  The next release will add support for manually specifying
	  a proxy when the server doesn't advertise one.

	Pidgin:
	* If a plugin says it can't be unloaded, we now display an error and
	  remove the plugin from the list of saved plugins so it won't load
	  at the next startup.  Previously, we were ignoring this case, which
	  could lead to crashes.
	* Mark dialog windows as transient for appropriate parent windows to
	  help window managers do the right thing  (Gabriel Schulhof)
	* Connection errors are now reported in mini-dialogs inside the buddy
	  list, rather than as buttons in the buddy list and with dialog
	  boxes.  If several accounts are disabled when you sign on elsewhere,
	  you can now re-enable them all with a single click.
	* Added tooltips to the Room List window to show full topics
	* Added buttons in preferences to access GNOME network and browser
	  preferences configuration dialogs when running under GNOME
	* If you alias a buddy to an alias that is already present within
	  a particular group, we now offer to merge the buddies into the
	  same contact.
	* A music emblem is now displayed in the buddy list for a buddy if we
	  know she is listening to some soothing music.
	* Added a 'Move to' menu in buddy list context menu for moving buddies
	  to other groups as an alternative to dragging.
	* Group headings are now marked via an underline instead of a
	  different color background.
	* It is now possible to mark a chat on your buddy list as "Persistent"
	  so you do not leave the chat when the window or tab is closed.
	* The auto-join option for chats is now listed in the "Add Chat"
	  dialog along with the new persistence option.
	* Closing an IM no longer immediately closes your conversation.  It
	  will now remain active for a short time so that if the conversation
	  resumes, the history will be retained.  A preference has been added
	  to toggle this behavior.
	* The "Smiley" menu has been moved to the top-level of the toolbar.
	* Pidgin's display is now saved with the command line for session
	  restoration.  (David Mohr)
	* ICQ Birthday notifications are shown as buddy list emblems.
	* Plugin actions are now available from the docklet context menu
	  in addition to the Tool menu of the buddy list.
	* The manual page has been heavily rewritten to bring it in line
	  with current functionality.

	Finch:
	* If a plugin says it can't be unloaded, we now display an error and
	  remove the plugin from the list of saved plugins so it won't load
	  at the next startup.  Previously, we were ignoring this case, which
	  could lead to crashes.
	* It's possible to bind key-strokes to specific menuitems in the windows.
	  Read the 'Menus' section in the man-page for details.
	* 'transpose-chars' operation for the entry boxes. The default key-binding
	  is ctrl+t.
	* 'yank' operation for the entry boxes. The default binding is ctrl+y.

version 2.2.2 (10/23/2007):
	https://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.2.2
		NOTE: Due to the way this release was made, it is possible that
			  bugs marked as fixed in 2.2.1 or 2.2.2 will not be fixed
			  until the next release.

	* Various bug and memory leak fixes
	* Look for a default prefs.xml in the CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA directory
	  (e.g. c:\Documents and Settings\All Users\
	        Application Data\purple\prefs.xml) on Windows, similarly to
	  how this is done on other platforms.

version 2.2.1 (09/29/2007):
	https://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.2.1
		NOTE: Due to the backporting that happened for the actual
		      release, it is possible bugs marked as fixed in 2.2.1
		      will not be fixed until 2.2.2.

	libpurple:
	* A few build issues on Solaris were fixed.
	* Cancelling the password prompt for an account will no longer leave
	  it in an ambiguous state.  (It will be disabled.)
	* Fixed an erroneous size display for MSN file transfers. (galt)

	  protocols
	* Fixed remembering proxy preferences and status scores
	* Gmail notifications are better tracked

	Pidgin:
	* Fixed keyboard tab reordering to move tabs one step instead of two.
	* You should no longer lose proxy settings when Pidgin is restarted.
	* Fixed detection of X11 when compiling

	Finch:
	* Pressing 'Insert' in the buddylist will bring up the 'Add Buddy'
	  dialog.

	https://developer.pidgin.im/query?status=closed&milestone=2.2.0

	libpurple:
	* New protocol plugin: MySpaceIM (Jeff Connelly, Google Summer of
	  Code)
	* XMPP enhancements. See
	  http://www.adiumx.com/blog/2007/07/soc-xmpp-update.php (Andreas
	  Monitzer, Google Summer of Code for Adium)
	* Certificate management. libpurple will validate certificates on
	  SSL-encrypted protocols (William Ehlhardt, Google Summer of Code)
	* Some adjustments were made to fix sending messages when using
	  the MSN HTTP method. (Laszlo Pandy)
	* Yahoo! Chat is fixed.
	* Some AIM file transfer issues between Pidgin and other clients
	  have been fixed. (Kyryll A Mirnenko)

	* Right-clicking the empty space in the formatting toolbar
	  allows you to toggle back to the old "ungrouped" version.
	* Protocols supporting account registration via Pidgin now show
	  a descriptive checkbox instead of a vague "Register" button.
	* Fixed a bug where a tab would be shown on single conversations
	  when tabs were disabled.

	Finch:
	* Per-conversation mute and logging options (accessible from the menu).

	* Only report conversation close when 'send typing notifications'
	  preference is turned on (Bob Rossi)

	Pidgin:
	* Show current outgoing conversation formatting on the font label on
	  the toolbar
	* Slim new redesign of conversation tabs to maximize number of
	  conversations that can fit in a window

	  drag and drop conversations from the infopane.
	* Moved "Reset Formatting" toolbar button to Font menu.
	* Double click on the infopane to alias buddies and set topics
	  on chats
	* New smiley style

	Finch:
	* Sound support (Eric Polino)

version 2.1.0 (07/28/2007):
	libpurple:
	* Core changes to allow UIs to use second-granularity for scheduling.
	  Pidgin and Finch, which use the glib event loop, were changed to use
	  g_timeout_add_seconds() on glib >= 2.14 when possible.  This allows
	  glib to better group our longer timers to increase power efficiency.
	  (Arjan van de Ven with Intel Corporation)
	* No longer linkifies screennames containing @ signs in join/part
	  notifications in chats
	* With the HTML logger, images in conversations are now saved.
	  NOTE: Saved images are not yet displayed when loading logs.
	* Added support for QIP logs to the Log Reader plugin (Michael Shkutkov)

	Pidgin:
	* Ensure only one copy of Pidgin is running with a given configuration
	  directory.  The net effect of this is that trying to start Pidgin a
	  second time will raise the buddy list.  (Gabriel Schulhof)
	* Undo capability in the conversation window
	* The formatting toolbar has been reorganized to be more concise.
	* A new status area has been added to the top of conversations to
	  provide additional detail about the buddy, including buddy icon,
	  protocol and status message.
	* Show idle times in the buddy list as days, hours, seconds

	Finch:
	* There's support for workspaces now (details in the manpage)
	* There's a new custom window manager, Irssi
	* Some improvements for tab-completion, tooltip and the password entries

	* Fixed smiley ordering in the insert smiley popup to be more intuitive
	* Conversation->More menu items work for Chats as well as Buddies,
	  including those not on your buddy list
	* newline plugin should work better with conversation colors plugin now
	* Get Info on users now provides immediate feedback that something is
