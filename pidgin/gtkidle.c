/*
 * pidgin_get_time_idle:
 *
 * Get the number of seconds the user has been idle.  In Unix-world
 * this is based on the X Windows usage.  In MS Windows this is
 * based on keyboard/mouse usage information obtained from the OS.
 * In MacOS X, this is based on keyboard/mouse usage information
 * obtained from the OS, if configure detected IOKit.  Otherwise,
 * MacOS X is handled as a case of X Windows.
 *
 * In Debian bug #271639, jwz says:
 *
 * Purple should simply ask xscreensaver how long the user has been idle:
 *   % xscreensaver-command -time
 *   XScreenSaver 4.18: screen blanked since Tue Sep 14 14:10:45 2004
 *
 * Or you can monitor the _SCREENSAVER_STATUS property on root window #0.
 * Element 0 is the status (0, BLANK, LOCK), element 1 is the time_t since
 * the last state change, and subsequent elements are which hack is running
 * on the various screens:
 *   % xprop -f _SCREENSAVER_STATUS 32ac -root _SCREENSAVER_STATUS
 *   _SCREENSAVER_STATUS(INTEGER) = BLANK, 1095196626, 10, 237
 *
 * See watch() in xscreensaver/driver/xscreensaver-command.c.
 *
 * Returns: The number of seconds the user has been idle.
